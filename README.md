### Technologies Used
* HTML/CSS/JavaScript
* Jquery/AJAX
* NodeJS
* Express
* Bulma

### The Goal
This small web app was created to fulfill the requirements of the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp and demonstrates the ability to create a full-stack web application using Node.js and Express.js. The data is stored as a JSON object within friends.js, new entries are saved using the npm native package 'fs'. Node is used in combination with Express to both set up the server and routes for the API and html files. 

### Overview

This app is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.
